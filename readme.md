Orbit: Shooty-Spinny Javascripty Game
#####################################

I'll write a better readme file later, one that will actually introduce the project, but this is a pretty simple shooter game proof-of-concept prototype based in javascript and html5 canvas.

MIT License and all that shit, I'll also actually include real licensing and stuff later. I'll do *EVERYTHING* later.

A lot of love to [@jlongster][0] for his [canvas-game-bootstra][1] project and accompanying tutorial
